Currently working with Gamut Predictive Analytics to improve data quality and visualizations. 

Previously worked on a project that took data from 58 technical research communities, 
condensed that data into one table, 
and helped to create multiple visualizations in Gapminder. 

The photo on my portfolio website is just a screenshot of one of the interactive charts
that was created in Gapminder. I have chosen not to share the data file or more of the visuals 
to respect the privacy of the company and the hard work they are doing to get started. 

The company is in early stages and will be releasing their website with more visualizations in the near future.
